Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to assess how well a model generalizes to an independent dataset. It is particularly useful for evaluating models when data is limited and to prevent overfitting. Here's a brief summary of why and how it is used:

Why Import Cross-Validation in Machine Learning?
Model Evaluation: Cross-validation provides a more reliable estimate of model performance compared to a simple train-test split, by making use of all the available data.
Overfitting Prevention: By training and validating the model on different subsets of data, cross-validation helps detect overfitting, ensuring the model performs well on unseen data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: It aids in selecting the best model parameters by evaluating the model performance on different subsets of data.
How Cross-Validation Works
The most common method is k-fold cross-validation:

Divide the Data: The dataset is randomly divided into k equal-sized folds (subsets).
Training and Validation: The model is trained on k-1 folds and validated on the remaining one fold. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different fold as the validation set.
Performance Aggregation: The results from each fold are averaged to give an overall performance estimate.
